Introducing the EMAX EM2.0 Connector: a lightweight, efficient solution for micro-sized drones. This connector stands out for its impressive weight reduction, with the male connector weighing approximately 0.4g and the female connector about 0.3g. In comparison, the XT30 connector weighs a total of 1.7g, marking a significant 59% reduction in weight.
The EMAX EM2.0 also features low internal resistance, with a value of just 12.5mΩ. This minimizes energy loss during power transfer, meaning less wasted energy, longer flight times, and increased efficiency. The connector's robust current capacity is notable as well, handling burst currents of up to 20A and continuous currents of 10A. This ensures reliable power delivery during demanding maneuvers and significantly outperforms the BT2.0, which handles 9A continuous and 15A burst currents, providing increased performance for 1s and 2s drones with more headroom.
Constructed from high-quality materials, the metal parts of the EM2.0 connector are made of gold-plated brass, while the shell is made of durable nylon. These materials strike a balance between conductivity and durability, ensuring longevity and consistent performance. The connector’s compact design, with male dimensions of 10.9mm × 7.1mm × 5.4mm and female dimensions of 10.1mm × 8.1mm × 6.4mm, allows for efficient integration into micro-sized drone designs.
In an effort to foster collaboration and innovation within the FPV micro industry, EMAX shares the EM2.0 connector’s design openly. This open-source approach invites any manufacturer to adopt the connector, emphasizing progress over exclusivity. The goal is to elevate the hobby collectively, ensuring the EM2.0 connector is not limited to EMAX products alone. The design can be accessed via our GitHub repository at https://github.com/EmaxModel/YINYAN-EMAX-EM2.0.
In summary, the EMAX EM2.0 connector offers significant weight savings, low resistance, high current handling capabilities, quality materials, and a compact form factor. Upgrade your micro drone’s power system with the EM2.0 for extended flight times and optimized performance!
