# Introducing the EMAX EM2.0 Connector
 A lightweight, efficient solution for micro-sized drones. Let’s dive into the details:
## Weight Advantage
The EMAX EM2.0 connector boasts an impressive weight reduction:

- **Male:** Approximately 0.4g
- **Female:** Approximately 0.3g

Compared to the XT30 connector weighing at 1.7g total, there is a significant 59% weight reduction.
## Low Internal Resistance
With an internal resistance of just 12.5mΩ, the EM2.0 minimizes energy loss during power transfer. Lower resistance means less wasted energy, resulting in longer flight times and increased efficiency.
## Current Handling:
The EM2.0 connector can handle:
- **Burst Current:** 20A
- **Continuous Current:** 10A

This robust current capacity ensures reliable power delivery during demanding maneuvers. Significant performance over the BT2.0 9A Continuous and 15A Burst, giving increased performance for 1s & 2s drones with more headroom.
## Quality Materials:
- **Metal parts:** Gold-plated brass
- **Shell:** Durable nylon 

These materials strike a balance between conductivity and durability, ensuring longevity and consistent performance.
## Compact Design

- **Male dimensions (including metal pins):** 10.9mm × 7.1mm × 5.4mm
- **Female dimensions (including metal pins):** 10.1mm × 8.1mm × 6.4mm
 
The compact size allows for efficient integration into micro-sized drone designs.

## Open Source
EMAX proudly shares the EM2.0 connector’s design with the entire FPV micro industry. Any manufacturer can adopt this connector, fostering collaboration and innovation. Our goal isn’t exclusivity; it’s progress. By embracing the EM2.0, we invite everyone to elevate the hobby together. The EM2.0 connector’s open-source nature ensures that it’s not limited to EMAX products alone.
